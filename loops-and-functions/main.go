/*
Computers typically compute the square root of x using a loop.
Starting with some guess z, we can adjust z based on how close zÂ² is to x, producing a better guess:

z -= (z*z - x) / (2*z)

Repeating this adjustment makes the guess better and better
until we reach an answer that is as close to the actual square root as can be.
